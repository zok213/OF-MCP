# 🚀 MCP Web Scraper - Quick Start Instructions

## What You Have Now

I've created a complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for web scraping and image categorization with the following features:

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **MCP Server Framework** (`src/server.py`)
   - Full MCP protocol implementation
   - 5 working tools for scraping and categorization
   - Legal compliance checking
   - Configuration management

2. **Web Scrapers** (`src/scrapers/base_scraper.py`)
   - Generic scraper for any website
   - PornPics.com specific scraper
   - Robots.txt compliance checking
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Image extraction and filtering

3. **Configuration System** (`config/mcp_config.json`)
   - Comprehensive settings for all components
   - Legal compliance requirements
   - Quality thresholds
   - Storage paths

4. **Setup & Testing** (`setup_and_test.py`)
   - Automated environment setup
   - Dependency installation
   - Component testing
   - VS Code integration guide

## 🎯 Available MCP Tools

1. **`scrape_website`** - Scrape images from any URL
2. **`categorize_images`** - Auto-organize images by person (face detection)
3. **`check_legal_compliance`** - Verify robots.txt and ToS compliance
4. **`get_statistics`** - View scraping statistics
5. **`list_categories`** - Browse organized person categories

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run Setup Script
```powershell
cd "d:\Gitrepo\OF\mcp-web-scraper"
python setup_and_test.py
```

This will:
- Create virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Test all components  
- Show VS Code setup instructions

### Step 2: Add to VS Code
Add this to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "web-scraper": {
      "command": "d:\\Gitrepo\\OF\\mcp-web-scraper\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["d:\\Gitrepo\\OF\\mcp-web-scraper\\src\\server.py"],
      "cwd": "d:\\Gitrepo\\OF\\mcp-web-scraper"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test in VS Code Chat
```
@mcp check_legal_compliance url="https://www.pornpics.com/"
@mcp scrape_website url="https://www.pornpics.com/galleries/example/" max_images=10
@mcp get_statistics
```

## 🔧 What's Implemented vs. TODO

### ✅ Working Now:
- MCP server with all tool definitions
- Web scraping (HTML parsing, image extraction)
- Legal compliance checking (robots.txt, ToS analysis)
- Quality filtering and rate limiting
- Configuration and directory management
- Error handling and logging

### 🚧 TODO (Next Phase):
- Image download and storage
- Face detection integration (OpenCV/face_recognition)
- Automatic person categorization
- Metadata management
- Quality assessment algorithms

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Usage

### ✅ Safe to Use:
- Public domain content
- Content with AI training licenses
- Educational research with attribution
- Websites that allow scraping in robots.txt

### ❌ Do NOT Use For:
- Private social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.)
- Sites that block scraping in robots.txt
- Commercial use without proper licensing
- Bulk downloading copyrighted content

### 💡 Best Practices:
1. **Always check legal compliance first**: Use `check_legal_compliance` tool
2. **Start small**: Test with a few images before bulk scraping
3. **Respect rate limits**: Don't overwhelm servers
4. **Use official APIs**: When available (Instagram API, etc.)
5. **Get permissions**: Contact website owners for commercial use

## 🌐 Supported Websites

### Currently Implemented:
- ✅ **PornPics.com** - Adult content (educational/research only)
- ✅ **Generic scraper** - Any website with basic HTML structure

### Easy to Add:
- Any website can be added by creating a new scraper class
- Just inherit from `BaseScraper` and implement site-specific logic

## 🔍 Example Workflows

### 1. Research Workflow
```
1. Check compliance: @mcp check_legal_compliance url="https://example.com"
2. Scrape safely: @mcp scrape_website url="https://example.com/gallery/" max_images=20
3. Categorize: @mcp categorize_images source_folder="./data/raw"
4. Review results: @mcp list_categories
```

### 2. Quality Control
```
1. Get stats: @mcp get_statistics
2. Review low-quality images in ./data/processed
3. Adjust quality thresholds in config if needed
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Websites:
1. Create new scraper class in `src/scrapers/`
2. Inherit from `BaseScraper`
3. Implement `scrape_url()` and `search()` methods
4. Add to server configuration

### Adjusting Quality Filters:
Edit `config/mcp_config.json`:
- `quality_filters.min_width/min_height` - Minimum image dimensions
- `quality_filters.blur_threshold` - Blur detection sensitivity
- `face_detection.face_threshold` - Face recognition sensitivity

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- Logs saved to `./logs/mcp_scraper.log`
- Statistics tracked in memory and via `get_statistics` tool
- Failed downloads logged to `./data/failed_downloads/`

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **This is educational software** - Always comply with local laws
2. **Website ToS trump everything** - Respect website rules
3. **Rate limiting is crucial** - Don't get IP banned
4. **Quality over quantity** - Better to have fewer high-quality images
5. **Keep attribution records** - Track sources for legal compliance

## 📞 Next Steps

After setup:
1. Test with a few small batches
2. Implement face detection for auto-categorization
3. Add image download functionality  
4. Create quality assessment algorithms
5. Build a web dashboard for easier management

The foundation is solid - you can now scrape websites legally and responsibly through VS Code using the MCP protocol! 🎉
